## 1. Overview
In this section provides a brief overview of the business problem.  By brief, it should include a single image (business process or use case diagram) and a textual explanation (describing actors, tasks, information, or outcomes) and described in *Step 4*.

Here is an example of including a image into your lab report using a URL:

## 2. Requirements
In this section, organize and list requirements from *Step 5*.  You are welcome to organize this section in anyway that you would like (using headings or tables).  The structure of this section should correspond to your overview section, and it is recommended that that you review the [lessons learned](../lessonsLearned.md) from your colleagues.

- Business: The system must process a meal order (including payment) provided
by a user to an on-campus provider
and have it delivered to the designated location/classroom. 

- User: The user shall order the meal and tell the system
where the classroom is. 

- Functional: The system should place the order to the desired cafe
and then tell the worker delivering it where the classroom is. 

- Non-Functional: The system should be able to sustain high traffic and handle 
many users at once. The system should also be able to process more
than one payment at a time. 

- System: The system should have an interface in which the user can place 
the order with all of the items currently on the menu. The system 
should also be able to process payment through Messiah's Dining
Dollars Services as well as print/process the order to the Chef 
in which the meal is cooked and given to the delivery man.
